## Bash Library

This git repositories contain a bunch of snippets from other bash scripts that i've found useful.

I've borrowed a lot of snippets from the following resources over the internet:
* [Bash Programming - Introduction](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html#toc8)
* Github


## Features

### if library

The if library contains a bunch of if functions that can easily be copied and pasted into your current script
<code>
#/bin/bash
source if.sh
prompt
</code>
